PoshChat GUI model: https://github.com/proxb/PoshChat 

Use Case: 

Engineers have no chat, no email, no real-time communication options within the boundaries of the airgap environment. Teams is not supported with no real ETA. The solution that has developed for highside-to-highside 

Functionality: 

Location on highside: P:\Chat\<Icon To Launch> 

Either a team-based or 1-on-1 individual chat sessions. 

Text-Based file I/O approach. Avoid Server based solution complexities. 

Ask for IMG / SNIP copy-paste feature. Cannot paste to text file, but write .png to folder and launch down path? 

Do not generate duplicate text files with the same name in folder – prompt / fail gracefully.
